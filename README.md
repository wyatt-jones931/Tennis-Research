Research on the impacts of handedness on professional tennis

As a part of Belmont University's SURFS program, I designed and carried out a study on the ways handedness, or someone's dominant hand, impacts the broad 
outcomes of professional tennis. For example: the representation of left-handed players in both the ATP and WTA, the amount of elite left-handed players, the 
length of matches by outcome and handedness, and the performance of each hand on court surfaces. This is the code I used to find my insights as well as create
visualizations for a paper and a poster.

The datasets used in this project are from Jeff Sackmann's comprehensive tennis_atp and tennis_wta datasets found on his github, and as such this project would
not have been possible without his works.
